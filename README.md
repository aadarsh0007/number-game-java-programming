It’s a classic game where the player tries to guess a secret number within a specified range. Here’s a brief breakdown of how your program works:

The game starts by displaying a welcome message, informing the player about the chosen number range and the number of attempts they have.
Inside the while (playAgain) loop, a random secret number is generated using the generateRandomNumber method.
The player then enters their guess, and the program provides feedback based on whether the guess is too high or too low.
If the player guesses correctly, their score increases, and they can choose to play again.
If the player exhausts all attempts, the correct secret number is revealed.
The game continues until the player decides not to play again.
